To ensure the imagery you receive is exceptional, we provide the following value added services:
•	Precision Orthorectificatioin (geo-referencing) for better horizontal accuracy. Ground Control Points and a Digital Elevatioin Model (DEM) are required to correct the imagery for terrain displacement.
•	Image mosaicing (combining multiple scenes/images into one seamless mosaic).
•	Combing multiple satellite imagery products (GeoEye-1, QuickBird, etc.) and multiple image acquisition dates into a single image mosaic.
•	Image enhancement
o	Filtering
o	Color / contrast manipulation
•	Image compression
•	Cloud minimization (usually vendor’s maximum cloud cover is 20%. We offer max 5%)
•	High resolution / large format photographic prints
