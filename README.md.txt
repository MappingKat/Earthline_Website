# WHAT is the services we offer, like green and brown estate mapping or land development projects.  

# HOW is the methods and means of how we collect the data.  This section will be divided into four sections (we can use the grid that Perry suggested in the meeting): Data Collection, Image Processing, Mapping and Training/Consulting (can include training material here).  

# WHO will include our teams and employees, as well as where we are located.  It should also have our partners listed. 

# WHERE shows where we have worked and will have the list of past clients via their logos, as well as case studies.  Three would be best.  

# RESOURCES is where we can put customer and marketing resources.  Namely, land classification schemes and maybe some MapInfo guides.  We could also put customer information here.
